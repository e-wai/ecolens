Revolutionizing the way we recycle - making something new again! 

### Our Tech Stack:
	* Firebase ML
	* Google Cloud Auto ML : for deep learning
	* Android Studio 
	* Java 

### What it Does:
Through **ecolens** revolutionize the way you recycle through a simple Android app interface that recognizes different “garbage” items from a live video stream through deep learning. After identifying the object, it returns various DIY and craft projects that can be made with the items! It brings together people of all ages in a fun matter while creating a **_big impact_** in the world around us. 

## To Use our App: 
* [Create a Firebase project in the Firebase console, if you don’t already have one](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup) 
* Add a new Android app into your Firebase project with package name com.google.firebase.ml.md
* Download the config file (google-services.json) from the new added app and move it into the module folder (i.e.  [app/](https://github.com/hanlinc27/ecolens/blob/master/app) )
* Build and run it on an Android device
